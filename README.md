ICS4U Summative Project Proposal

a.	I am aiming to code a complex level program.

b.	What I will be coding is Tetris, it is a Russian-made puzzle video game. I will be recreating my own remake of it. How the game works is there are 6 game pieces that are called tetrominoes. They are shaped as follows, L, I, S, Z, O, T. They fall from the middle of the top of a 2-D plane who’s size is about W 1:2 L. The goal of the game is to fill a whole horizontal row with block pieces, and when this happens, that row will cancel out and you will get points. You are allowed to freely rotate the given shapes as desired. Points will be counted My goal is to create this game as well as add my own twist to it. I would like to create a sort of AI which would play the game on one plane one the user plays in another plane. 

c.	I will be using the Python library “pygame” to create a Graphical User Interface in which the game’s player is able to interact with the game through pressing a specific set of keys. I will also, if possible, create a difficulty slider that will determine how fast the blocks will go. I will also add another difficulty slider specifically for the AI to increase its difficulty as well.  

d.	I think that a big obstacle will be to create the AI. It will be hard because with my limited resources and Python knowledge it will be hard to code something that can play a game properly and at least at an intermediate level. I think another problem may be that it will be hard to get the blocks to stack together and cancel out especially since they are not the same block and would be created with different functions. 

e.	A way to display the tetrominoes (Tetris game pieces)
A way to make the tetrominoes fall 
A grid in which the game is displayed
Set physical boundaries for the tetrominoes
A way to delete rows once one is filled
Different colored tetrominoes
A way to end the game once the player loses

f.	A way to count score once a row is filled
A way to speed up the game as time goes on
The AI to actually work properly 
Different modes that are available to play
